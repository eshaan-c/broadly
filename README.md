LLM-powered tool helping users make better decisions by turning natural language into structured decision frameworks.

##
##
Natural language input → No forms or frameworks to learn

Personalized to user values → Questions about context, not generic evaluation

Structured thinking without the work → AI does the framework creation

Depth flexibility → From 2-minute gut checks to deep analysis

Unbiased mirror → Reflects priorities back, doesn't judge
